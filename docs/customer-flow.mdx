# Create Your Data Flow

In real development scenarios, we often face the challenge of verifying a data flow or part of a data flow. In these scenarios, we may need to generate data then use them in the next step of the data flow.
To achieve it, you can apply both the [user data input](./customer-data) and [extra data file](./output-control#extra-output-file) features in your generation.
With both input and output files coordinated, you can link multiple data generations to dovetail into your data flow requirement.
