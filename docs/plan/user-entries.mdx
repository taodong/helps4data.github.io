# Data Injection
It’s a common scenario to want to inject your own data into the generated data. Some typical use cases include: obfuscating sensitive information, supplementing with additional data, or incorporating data from an alternative source. The ‘entries’ feature in the plan file provides you with considerable flexibility to accomplish these objectives.

## Define Entries
An `entries` element comprises the following two attributes:

- **properties**: A list of property names to which values will be assigned.
- **values**: A list of records that will be utilized. Each defined record should contain the same number of values as specified in ‘properties’. All the values provided within a record must be in text format, denoted with double quotes at both ends.

```yaml title="Sample entries"
- entity: "product"
  count: 10
  entries:
    properties:
      - "name"
      - "desc"
      - "sku"
      - "category_id"
    values:
      - ["tv_1", "desc_1", "elect00001", "1"]
      - ["tv_2", "desc_2", "elect00002", "1"]
      - ["hp_win", "a computer", "comp000001", "2"]
```

## Rules for Applying Entries
When applying entries, the following rules are enforced:

1. The records provided in the ‘entries’ are utilized in the specified order before the commencement of any generation.
2. If the properties listed do not encompass all the properties of the entity, the unlisted properties will be generated according to the user’s configuration.
3. If the number of records provided in ‘entries’ is less than the specified count, the additional records will be generated in accordance with the user’s configuration.

For example, to obfuscate sensitive information, you can simply exclude any sensitive data when defining the entries.
